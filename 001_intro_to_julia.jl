    A quick introduction to the Julia programming language for scientific modelling.

    Why Julia 
    - Julia is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language.
    - Julia is designed for numerical and scientific computing.
    - Julia is open source and free to use.
    - Julia has a simple and easy-to-learn syntax.

    All programming languages are cool! And especially python/MATLAB have proven 
    to be useful! 

    However. Both suffer from the two language problem: 
    - high level code is written in python 
    - high performance code relies on C/C++ implementations (numpy, pytorch, etc)

    The aim was to make both possible in one language. -> Julia!
